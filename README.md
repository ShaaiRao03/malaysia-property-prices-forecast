This project utilizes machine learning techniques, including RandomForestRegressor, to accurately forecast property prices across Malaysia. The predictive model is engineered to consider various features such as facilities availability, tenure type, and land title (bumi, non-bumi). The trained model is able to achieve an R-squared score of 0.81. It covers apartments, condominiums, and service residences, catering to diverse market segments. This project provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry and empowers informed decision-making.
